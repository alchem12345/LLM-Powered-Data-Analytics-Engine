# LLM-Powered-Data-Analytics-Engine
Built a precision-focused LLM agent using LangChain and Streamlit to query databases via natural language. I eliminated hallucinations and "info-dumps" by architecting a ReAct-based validation sandbox that pre-screens logic and maps semantic schemas, ensuring the AI provides accurate, filtered insights instead of raw data or errors.
